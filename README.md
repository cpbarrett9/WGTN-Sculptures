<h1><a href="https://cpbarrett9.github.io/wellington-sculpture-map/">Wellington Sculpture Map</a></h1>

This project is an interactive map of public sculptures in Wellington, New Zealand.
The dataset is based on the Wellington Sculpture Trust’s collection, and was
created using information available on the WST’s website. Users can view a
representation of each sculpture’s geographic location, and can click on each
marker to view information about that sculpture (title, artist, description, image,
etc). Users can also organize by collection (Wellington City Walk, Botanic Garden
Walk, etc) and view the suggested walking route for viewing that group of
sculptures. There’s also a live location feature, search feature, a navigation tab for
the website’s four pages, and a general information panel in the bottom left
(iFrame of the Wellington Sculpture Trust Website).
