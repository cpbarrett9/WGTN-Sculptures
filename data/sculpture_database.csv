Walk the Line,Joe Sheehan,2015,"Cenotaph Precinct, Bowen Street","231 carved jade discs, speaker units","The Wellington Sculpture Trust commissioned Walk the Line, a sculpture by artist Joe Sheehan, within the Cenotaph Memorial precinct, Wellington, to mark the historic Wai Piro Stream. The work was included in the redesign of the precinct to mark the original bed of the stream which once flowed down what is now Bowen Street across the precinct to the nearby foreshore. The stream was culverted many years ago and is now running below Bowen Street, Lambton Quay and Whitmore Street. With Joe’s installation the old path of the Wai Piro Stream is marked by 231 carved jade discs, meandering as a ‘stream’ through the precinct. They are carved from a range of Nephrite types sourced from the West Coast of New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Russia, Mongolia and China. Almost all the pieces have been collected by the artist over the past 15 years. Running under the discs is a below-ground speaker system providing the sound of a running stream, all recorded from several stretches of water around e Ahumairangi/Mt Tinakori which feed the Wai Piro stream.",https://www.sculpture.org.nz/store/images/Wellington%20Sculpture%20Trust_Walk%20the%20Line_lowRez_07-big.jpg,https://www.sculpture.org.nz/the-sculptures/walk-the-line,https://maps.app.goo.gl/5Pu5UQXK7KTJ7kV87,174.7772017,-41.27915254,Wellington City Walk,permanent

The Philanthropist's Stone,Scott Eady,2015,Cuba Street, ,"The work to commemorate and celebrate the prominent Wellington businessman and philanthropist, Thomas George Macarthy was unveiled on 12 August 2015. A joint project between the T G Macarthy Trust and the Wellington Sculpture Trust, it marks the centenary of the Trust T G Macarthy established on his death in 1912. Situated in lower Cuba Street, not far from the Michael Fowler Centre, the work has already claimed this space and commands attention. At over 6 metres high the sculpture sits upon a pedestal and includes a tall blue Corinthian column and hand carved capital, with a large gold plated bronze nugget on top. Protruding from the nugget are candles with hand-blown glass lights which at night illuminate the sculpture and its surroundings. The gold nugget references the gold rush that brought Macarthy to New Zealand, and the column is typical of the classical modern architectural features used in/on buildings around the early 1900s. The candles are celebratory but also speak to the way the Trust has been a beacon of hope for countless numbers since its inception, providing $61.4 million to charitable causes throughout the Greater Wellington region.",https://www.sculpture.org.nz/store/images/TPS-web-5-big.jpg,https://www.sculpture.org.nz/the-sculptures/the-philanthropists-stone,https://maps.app.goo.gl/qj9vvjcvvCwN7M728,174.7774553,-41.29013532,Wellington City Walk,permanent

Since graduating from Elam School of Fine Arts she has undertaken several private and public commissions. Per Capita means “for each head of population”. The composition of the work is very simple; it’s a 4 piece puzzle. Yet the pieces don’t fit together. So it is not simple anymore. An obvious sense of fitting and belonging is immediately confounded.

Kimi / You are here,Seung Yol Oh,2025,Waitangi Park,Polished stainless steel / 5.5meter tall 3.7meter diameter,"Seung’s work KIMI / You Are Here is sited in the coastal planting area within the old shipping dry-dock. At 5.5 metres, it can be seen from near and far and appears nestled within the vegetation from many viewpoints, but in fact it sits at the end of the path, creating an element of concealment and discovery. The work is highly engineered with a delicate point of connection to the ground. It gently touches the concrete path and appears to be virtually suspended through clever concealment of its foundations. This is all thanks to the exceptional work of the engineers, Dunning Thornton, and the commitment, care, and precision of the fabricators: Kerry Fowler and his team at Global Stainless in Taranaki. Working with the designers of Waitangi Park, Wraight Landscape Architects, Athfield Architects, and the Wellington City Council were also instrumental in the selection of the site and the integration of the sculpture into it. Just like a ‘pin drop’, KIMI / You Are Here is a dramatic statement and marker of the site. The inverted teardrop made of stainless steel reflects the grasses and plants surrounding it and the people who take the path less trodden to stand at its base. With its strong visual presence across the park and from the surrounding road, it invites viewers to seek it out, first needing to find the path, leading to a more intimate engagement.",https://www.sculpture.org.nz/store/images/KIMI-image.2-big.jpg,https://www.sculpture.org.nz/the-sculptures/kimi-/-you-are-here-,https://maps.app.goo.gl/VPkueQSmjACaUJ7M8,174.7839355,-41.29107249,Wellington City Walk,permanent

The Grove,Glen Hayward,2022,"Whitmore Plaza, Wellington Waterfront",Recycled wood from Wellington ferry wharves,"The Grove consists of 16 ‘copper headed nails’ of various heights hammered into the pavement. The shou sugi ban method of burning the exterior of the wood and applying oils accentuates the hand scalloping and provides the wood with one of the best preservatives known. Sue Elliott, Chair of the Trust, said the route to commission this work began with “the donation of some of the timbers and other relics from the Inconstant (later to be known as Plimmer’s Ark) for the Trust’s use in commissioning a sculpture. Sadly the semi-preserved wood proved unsuitable for a work located in the variable temperatures in Wellington’s outdoors. However, through our commissioning process, Glen provided an outstanding proposal: inspired by the copper headed nails he found among the artefacts, and used in shipbuilding in the 1800s. He proposed a grove of these nails ‘hammered’ into the reclaimed land, carved from timbers once used on the wharves.” Glen Hayward says “This has been a marvellous opportunity for me as usually the process in the studio is such an intimate experience. Through the requirements of scale for this work I was coaxed into a telescopic relationship with the sculptures and working with a larger team.”",https://www.sculpture.org.nz/store/images/The-Grove-image.1.png,https://www.sculpture.org.nz/the-sculptures/the-grove,https://maps.app.goo.gl/jgXU9hd9syZ7B2uJ9,174.7791292,-41.2819969,Wellington City Walk,permanent

The Wellington Sculpture Trust recognised that the dark and cheerless Shed 21 Colonnade on Waterloo Quay (opposite the railway station) presented a perfect opportunity for a light-based artwork that would be visible both day and night. Auckland-based artist Eddie Clemens’ proposal for the space fitted the brief perfectly, offering a work that is recognisable, relatable and whimsical — one that creates an engaging and uplifting experience for pedestrians within this architecturally significant heritage site. Each of the seven roller-brush units contains 1,000 addressable LEDs programmed to display a range of colourful animations, ensuring the work continues to mesmerise those passing through the colonnade each day.
